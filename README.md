This project is a simple algorithm that reads a sentence character by character and calculates three things: the number of characters, the number of words, and the number of vowels. 
The sentence ends with a period (.), and words are assumed to be separated by single spaces. The algorithm uses three counters to keep track of each value.
It reads each character one at a time, checks if it's a space, a vowel, or another character, and updates the counters accordingly. At the end, it displays the total length, word count, and vowel count.
